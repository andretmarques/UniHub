  'Q: Can anyone use the APP?':
  'A: Everyone who belongs to the University community can use the APP. '
      'But there are some constraints applied to non-students.',

  'Q: What can students do that others can’t?':
  'A: Everyone can post or create a task. Only the students can perform these tasks.',

  'Q: Why are the tasks only performed by students?':
  'A: The main goal is to have a community based Application while giving the ones '
      'who need the most some help on tuition’s payments. '
      'Generally these are students, allowing tasks to be performed for an '
      'improved University environment while helping the students with rewards.',

  'Q: How does one student get rewards/discounts?':
  'A: When a user assigns and successfully performs a task, '
      'he gets rewarded proportionally to the number of evaluations (or likes) '
      'the community has given to the task performed by that same user. '
      'The more likes one has, the greater the discount will be.',

  'Q: Who can evaluate the tasks?':
  'A: Everyone who belongs to the University community. '
'Which are also the ones who have access to the App.',

  'Q: How to evaluate one task?':
  'A: On the home page, an image is prompted. That is the preview of the task. '
      'On clicking it some more details about the task are presented. '
      'To evaluate positively, simply click on the heart button or swipe right. '
      'To dislike, click the X or swipe left.',

  'Q: Why are 5 task evaluations mandatory, frequently? '
      'Why can’t I assign myself and perform a task?':
  'A: As stated, the main goal is to have a community based Application. '
      'To get and receive rewards you have to give it to others. '
      'This is only applied if there are a minimum number of tasks '
      'available to be either liked or disliked.',

  'Q: Where can students use the tokens?':
  'A: The main goal is to give the ones who need the most. '
      'For now the tokens can be spent on tuition’s payments, '
      'but more options will be made available later.',
