A new way of paying University fees.

## Getting Started


  ### #1 Choose

    Choose some pending tasks, ready to be performed. Tasks can be submitted by everyone.

    From helping a colleague on a subject to selling tickets to an event. Everyone is welcome to ask for and give help.



  ### #2 Perform

    Perform the task(s). Within the chosen ones, get them done.

    Choosing something is always a responsibility. Act and treat it as so.

    Enjoy!
